# Roblox Projects

so far, I have these projects publicly shown below.

# [Drax Ware](Drax-Ware)

#### What's DraxWare?

Drax Ware It is an all-purpose tool with these features. As: 
Esp, Aimbot, & Macros (Yes, This Aimbot Has Prediction Built In; I Took My Time To Make Ai Prediction
And Bac Prediction And Combine Them Both Into 1, Making Drax Ware The Best One Out There); plus a lot more.

#### Drax Ware Information: 

Drax Ware Is Free! :tada:

"On a shitbox, Drax Ware doesn't cause any frame rate decreases for me. - User 0912"

Unnamed-Esp and Ro-Ware are competitors of Drax Ware ( Developed By Such amazing scripters)

In conclusion, neither Ro-Ware nor Unnamed esp were able to defeat Drax Ware in the majority 
of games... In terms of 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 and 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 
(a lot of games failed to pass the test of esp or esp and aimbot) Drax Ware works in all Roblox games.

# [Coming Soon BAC V2.0](BAC-V2.0)

#### What's BAC?

It only took about 12 days to create the custom script known as BAC, which allows you to play 
the game (legitly or with fury).

Developed for [Assassin](https://www.roblox.com/games/379614936/Assassin).

# [Preview] [Ai Assist V2.0](Ai-Assist-V2.0)

#### What's Ai Assist?

Ai Assist is a script that I created for individuals whose privacy is crucial. This script is exclusively 
for really legitimate play, and it makes it impossible to distinguish between hacking and legitimacy.

Developed for [Assassin](https://www.roblox.com/games/379614936/Assassin).

# [Coming Soon Laser X V2.0](Laser-X-V2.0)

#### What's DraxWare?

Assassin is likely going to take a lot of damage from the return of Laser X, which will have a 
silent aim that can penetrate walls and an instant hit in version 2.0. The addition of hitboxes will improve accuracy.
